# Cracking the Coding Interview
This program contains Python 2 implementations of string/list coding challenges
from the Cracking the Coding Interview book. Each function is intended to solve
a challenge, as indicated below. For each solution, I'm simplifying the string
to only lowercase letters, and performing the algorithm on those.

# 1.4: Palindrome Permutation() 
The function palindrome() is for the following: Given a string, write a 
function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a 
word or phrase that is the same forwards and bakcwards. A permutation is a 
rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just 
dictionary words.

# 1.6 String Compression()
The function compress() is for the following: Implement a method to perform
basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example,
the string 'aabcccccaaa' would be come 'a2b1c5a3'. If the "compressed" string
would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return
the original string.
